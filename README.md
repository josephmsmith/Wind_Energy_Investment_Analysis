# Gone With The Wind: Investment Analysis
Used SQL, Tableau, Python(Pandas), to analyze Global Energy market and more specifically the US Wind Market for Potential Investors. 
Worked with Camille Hobbs, Connor Edwards, and Esther Choe to complete this project in a 4 day sprint using task backlog and trello. 

## Introduction
Wind power has become an increasingly important source of renewable energy in the global energy market. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), wind power is the second-largest source of renewable energy after hydropower and is expected to continue to grow in importance in the coming years. In 2019, the market size was valued at $62.1 billion, and it's projected to reach $127.2 billion by 2027 - that's a growth rate of 9.3%. 

As far as trends go, we can see :
1. Offshore is becoming more prevalent
2. An increasing use of energy storage as plants become more efficient and generate more power
3. Large corporations setting standards for renewable energy
4. Larger Turbines

 - Net generation: How much are operators currently producing?
 - Market Share: How much of the market does each operator own?
 - OEM Usage: What technologies are they using?
 - Capacity: What are individual operators potential production rates?
 - Turbine Count: How many total turbines do they have in operation?
